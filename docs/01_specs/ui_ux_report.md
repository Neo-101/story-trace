# UI/UX Improvement & Bug Report

## 1. Feature Request: Direct Access to Global Overview
**Problem**:
Currently, clicking the "Overview" (概览) button in the navigation bar does not directly open the "Full Book Overview" page (as shown in the screenshot). Instead, it seems to require selecting a specific chapter first, or the navigation flow is confusing.

**Requirement**:
*   When the user clicks the main "Overview" tab/button, they should be immediately taken to the **Global Overview** page (the card list view showing all chapters).
*   This page should be the default entry point for the "Overview" section.

## 2. Bug Report: "Read Mode" (精读) Blank Screen
**Issue**:
In the Global Overview page (card list view), clicking the "Intensive Reading" (精读 ->) button on a chapter card causes the entire page to turn blank.

**Symptoms**:
*   Clicking the button triggers a navigation or state change.
*   The target page (likely the Chapter Detail/Read view) fails to render.
*   Result: White screen of death.

**Potential Causes (for future investigation)**:
*   **Routing Error**: The URL generated by the button might be incorrect or missing parameters.
*   **Vue Reactivity**: The component might be trying to access data that isn't loaded yet.
*   **Data Structure**: The merged data might be missing specific fields expected by the Reader component.

## 3. Feature Request: Auto-Scroll to Chapter in Overview (New)
**Problem**:
When selecting a chapter from the dropdown while in "Overview" mode, the corresponding card is highlighted but often out of view (e.g., Chapter 18 is far down the page). The user must manually scroll to find it. Also, the initial "Select Novel" action doesn't feel like it "completes" the overview loading process.

**Requirement**:
*   **Auto-Focus**: When a chapter is selected via dropdown, the Overview page should automatically scroll to center that chapter's card.
*   **Direct Entry**: Selecting a novel should immediately present the full Overview grid without requiring further clicks.

## Action Plan
*   [x] Refactor `index.html` / `app.js` navigation logic to make Global Overview the default view for the Overview tab.
    *   Implemented full-width grid layout for Overview mode.
    *   Added `showOverview` method to reset view state.
*   [x] Debug the "精读" button click handler to fix the white screen issue.
    *   Added `enterIntensiveReading` async method to ensure data is loaded before view switch.
    *   Applied to all "Intensive Reading" entry points.
*   [x] Implement Auto-Scroll and Focus logic for Overview cards.
    *   Add `id` attributes to chapter cards in `index.html`.
    *   Add watcher for `selectedChapterId` in `app.js` to trigger `scrollIntoView`.
    *   Ensure `fetchRuns` resets view to Overview mode.
